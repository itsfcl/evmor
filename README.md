The rollup adventure (some calls it fcl's delirium), with a few twists

Overview :
 - JS/TS only for client (anything actually good is banned)
 - No copying contracts (which means no yoinking other ORs)
 - Sequencer rotation right from the start (this will be fun)
 - 6o8+ multisig from the start (this will also be fun)
 - No EOAs from the start (other for sequencers and validators)

As you can tell, it will be fun (PlasmaPower will most likely laugh at me when he sees those conditions), but it will make a good case study

I may or may not develop brain cancer
